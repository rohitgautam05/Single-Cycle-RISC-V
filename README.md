# Single-Cycle-RISC-V
Implementing the datapath for multiple RISC-V instruction types to analyze how components like the ALU, register file, and control signals interact during instruction execution. It is the implementation of Single cycle architecture given in Harris and Harris, Digital Design and Computer Architecture (RISC V Edition)
